# **Dear visitor:**

Hey, I'm Michael. I am a senior at Portola High School. For a while now, coding has evolved as a medium for me to express my thoughts and passions. This Github profile will take you along that journey. In addition, feel free to check out my website: https://www.michael-yi.com. Thanks for stopping by!

Warm regards,
Michael
